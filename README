GibberishTrix
=============

0. script/plugin install git://github.com/ncr/gibberish_trix.git

1. Define a method #current_language in your ApplicationController. It should return current language as a string or better a symbol to be used by Gibberish (:de, :en, :pl, whatever you like).

2. Learn how to use Gibberish. Put your translations of the following in your lang/something.yml.

error_inclusion: "is not included in the list"
error_exclusion: "is reserved"
error_invalid: "is invalid"
error_confirmation: "doesn't match confirmation"
error_accepted : "must be accepted"
error_empty: "can't be empty"
error_blank: "can't be blank"
error_too_long: "is too long (maximum is %d characters)"
error_too_short: "is too short (minimum is %d characters)"
error_wrong_length: "is the wrong length (should be %d characters)"
error_taken: "has already been taken"
error_not_a_number: "is not a number"
error_greater_than: "must be greater than %d"
error_greater_than_or_equal_to: "must be greater than or equal to %d"
error_equal_to: "must be equal to %d"
error_less_than: "must be less than %d"
error_less_than_or_equal_to: "must be less than or equal to %d"
error_odd: "must be odd"
error_even: "must be even"

3. Translate your tables/columns. Given you have posts table with title and body and people table with name and body:

attr_post_title: Post title
attr_post_body: Post body
attr_person_name: Your name
attr_person_body: Your body

4. Enjoy error messages (in your favourite language) like this: 

Post title can't be blank

or

Your name is not included in the list

or

Your body has already been taken
